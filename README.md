# React Roadmap Milestones

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
The React Roadmap Milestones component **Under construction** is a board with a lot of features, functionalities or whatever where a user can see all of them divided by categories and milestones.

Several examples than can help us to understand it:
- **Cookbook**: maybe you what add recipes of different categories and you what show it by milestones as timeline or book version.
- **Video game**: where we can see the different features (deployed, in development or to be develop) in several milestones as a timeline.
- **Software project** like this component. Yes, use this component to explain the evolution of himself.
- Definitely **The evolution of any project or idea to be showed by milestones**.

Currently this project show us a fake data where the own evolution of this component in versions.

## Future ideas to be developed (suggestions are accepted)
- Overwrite styles, to allow config your own CSS.
